# W503 - line break before binary operator
#
# The reason for adding W503 to the ignored list is because W503 (Line break
# occurred before a binary operator) and W504 (Line break occurred after a binary
# operator) are both enabled in flake8 by default for some reason.  But they are
# mutually exclusive so one has to be disabled / ignored.
#
# According to pep8 at the time of the commit
# https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#should-a-line-break-before-or-after-a-binary-operator
#
# ```
# income = (gross_wages +
#           taxable_interest +
#           (dividends - qualified_dividends) -
#           ira_deduction -
#           student_loan_interest)
# income = (gross_wages
#           + taxable_interest
#           + (dividends - qualified_dividends)
#           - ira_deduction
#           - student_loan_interest)
# ```
#
# W504 (Line break occurred after a binary operator) is the correct behavior.

# Exclude the git directory and virtualenv directory (as `.env`)
